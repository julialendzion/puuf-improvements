              The people who work at PUUF are anxious. And quite frankly, worried. “A better world starts with yourself” so we’re starting with
              ourselves. We are passionate about beautiful, cool and fun design. We love making and surrounding ourselves with things we like looking
              at. But we are always taking into consideration the action of upcycling, recycling and sustainability. Being frugal with our scarce
              natural resources is key.

            <h1>Work. Kind of.</h1>
            <p>
              We love what we do. It feels almost wrong to call it work. It’s just who we are. Our “work” also includes ping-pong and a Thursday night
              bar. Dogs at the office? Of course there are. <br />Plastic recycling station and warehouse in the office? Naturally. Our studio is also
              home to other like-minded artists and brands. <br />If you’re interested in a “job” or an internship, send an inspiring email to
